            <h2>Intermediate</h2>
            <p>After completing my schooling, I continued my academic journey by pursuing my intermediate education in the science stream. With a strong focus on subjects like Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry, I worked diligently to enhance my knowledge and skills. My efforts were rewarded when I scored an impressive 979 out of 1000, reflecting my hard work and commitment to excellence. This phase of education was crucial as it prepared me for competitive exams and solidified my understanding of core subjects. The rigorous coursework and discipline I developed during these two years were instrumental in shaping my academic path toward engineering.</p>
            
            <h2>Btech</h2>
            <p>Currently, I am pursuing my B.Tech, where I have consistently maintained a strong academic performance with a CGPA of 9.45. My engineering studies have not only expanded my technical knowledge but also allowed me to explore various domains within computer science. From building projects using modern technologies like the MERN stack to solving complex problems in algorithms and data structures, my B.Tech journey has been both challenging and rewarding. I have actively participated in hackathons, technical events, and extracurricular activities, which have helped me apply theoretical concepts to real-world scenarios. My passion for continuous learning and problem-solving has driven me to excel in both academics and hands-on experiences during this phase.</p>
